# :star2:Ames Housing Prices : Data Visualization Hands-on:star2:

This work is data visualization hands-on of Ames Housing Prices dataset, downloaded from Kaggle. Even though it looks simple, all plot were created attractively using a few of libraries and methods you may have never heard of before (includes Geospatial Visualization). This work was done in R (Rstudio) and tidyverse environment. Reviewed by my mentor at dibimbing.id wtih score 100/100 as he said, "*The visualization results are already on par with what is expected in the industry*" üëç.

## Objectives
Data used in this work is House Sale Prices in Ames, Iowa, USA from 2006-2010, downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques). Overall, this work visualized :

- Univariate analysis of certain categorical variable
- Univariate analysis of certain numerical variable
- Bivariate analysis between categorical and numerical variable
- Bivariate analysis between numerical and numerical variable
- Geospatial visualization of houses within the dataset

In addition to the plot, the insights obtained from each visualization will also be explained clearly and concisely.

## Libraries
As explained before, this work mainly done using tidyverse environment. However, i also used another libraries to make plots looks more attractive such as :

- [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/)
- [gghighlight](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gghighlight/vignettes/gghighlight.html)
- [patchwork](https://patchwork.data-imaginist.com/)
- [ggridges](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggridges/vignettes/introduction.html#:~:text=The%20ggridges%20package%20provides%20two,then%20draws%20those%20using%20ridgelines.)
- [reshape2](https://seananderson.ca/2013/10/19/reshape/)
- [AmesHousing](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/AmesHousing/index.html) (extract longitude and latitude informations)
